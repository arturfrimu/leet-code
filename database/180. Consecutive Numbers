Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
 

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.


SOLUTION 1:

SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1
         JOIN Logs l2 ON l2.id = l1.id + 1 AND l2.num = l1.num
         JOIN Logs l3 ON l3.id = l1.id + 2 AND l3.num = l1.num;
         
SELECT DISTINCT Middle.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs Middle
JOIN Logs Prior ON Middle.id - 1 = Prior.id
JOIN Logs Next ON Middle.id + 1 = Next.id
WHERE Prior.num = Middle.num AND Next.num = Middle.num;


SOLUTION 2:

WITH numbered AS (SELECT id,
                         num,
                         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY num ORDER BY id) AS grp
                  FROM Logs)
SELECT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM numbered GROUP BY num, grp HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
